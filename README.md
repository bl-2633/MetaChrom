# [MetaChrom]()

MetaChrom is a transfer learning framework that takes advantage of both an extensive compendium of publicly available chromatin profiles data, and epigenomic profiles of cell types related to specific phenotypes of interest. It's capable of predicting the genomic variant effect on epigenomic profiles with single-nucleotide resolution.

*(A)Overall architecture of MetaChrom. The input sequence is fed into both the meta-feature extractor and the ResNet sequence encoder. Their outputs are then concatenated for the prediction of epigenomic profiles.(B)Pipeline for predicting variant effect on sequence epignomic profile.*
